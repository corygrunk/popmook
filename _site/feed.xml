I’ve gone through a handful of tutorials (&lt;a href=&quot;http://brackeys.com/&quot;&gt;Brackeys&lt;/a&gt; - thank you!!!!). I started to look into Blender tutorials but quickly became overwhelmed and dishearten. Then, a few days ago I decided to look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPiCgCkHTE&amp;amp;list=PLPV2KyIb3jR42oVBU6K2DIL6Y22Ry9J1c&quot;&gt;Brackey’s 2D Platformer&lt;/a&gt; course. I was once again energized. I may know nothing about 3D, but I’ve used Photoshop for years, and am confident I can make my own mediocre graphics!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, I’m embarrassed to admit this, but I never put together that a “platformer” was a game where you run across platforms. The more you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by drawing a pixel version of my old, crappy car. My kids have named her “Field”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://popmook.com/assets/images/IMG_0381.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My old crappy car&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped it in my 2D Platformer tutorial and quickly realized that cars behave weird when they’re replacing characters. Oh well, it was a fun experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of a car, I drew up a pixel version of my kids. If you don’t have kids, you may think this is super lame, but I don’t care. You have free time and expendable income. I have two rad, funny, kids who may be the only ones that play this game.&lt;/p&gt;

Unity impressed me with how quickly you can get up and running and there seems to be a pretty large community to answer questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culmination of these tutorials was &lt;strong&gt;Sheep Blaster&lt;/strong&gt;. I didn’t want to do guns because I wanted my kids to play around with it (super lame, Dad!). This is funnier though. I didn’t model any of the objects. That was going to be my next step, but I was way too overwhelmed with Blender modeling and rigging. I just wanted to get something up and running that I created myself. I’m a designer before I’m a developer. Anyway, here’s what my first little game looked like, and I use the term ‘game’ loosely.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm slowly wrapping my head around some basic Unity 2D concepts. I took a break from the tutorials and started working on understanding sprites and animation. I've been keeping the artwork super simple and started to create walk sequences. My first one looked like she was doing the running man dance.

After that, I swtiched to pixel art mode because you can make the art super quickly and it looks "ok" while I'm learning. I stole a background from the internet, but will replace it later. Keeping the art sorta polished helps with my motivation. When I put everything together I ended up with a dude that can walk back and forth and shoot arrows. Neat.

Here's the arrow dude shooting other arrow dudes (the background image is from [here](https://edermunizz.itch.io/free-pixel-art-forest).)

Next I need to learn about enemy AI and blasting them with pixel lasers.

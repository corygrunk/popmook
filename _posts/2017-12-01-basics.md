I'm slowly wrapping my head around some basic Unity 2D concepts. I took a break from the tutorials I was doing and started to understand sprites and how to animate them. I've been keeping the artwork super simple and starting to create walk sequences. My first one looked like she was doing the running man dance.

After that, I swtiched to pixel art mode because you can make the art super quickly and it looks "ok" while I'm learning. I stole a background from the internet, but will replace it later. I just liked everything looking like a game. Putting everything together I ended up with a dude that can walk back and forth and shoot arrows. Neat.

Here's the arrow dude shooting other arrow dudes (the background image is from [here](https://edermunizz.itch.io/free-pixel-art-forest).)

Next I need to learn about enemy AI and blasting them with pixel lasers.

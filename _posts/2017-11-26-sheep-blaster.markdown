Last summer I spent some evenings going through a bunch of Unity tutorials. Unity impressed me with how quickly you can get up and running and there seems to be a pretty large community to answer questions.

The culmination of these tutorials was **Sheep Blaster**. I didn't want to do guns because I wanted my kids to play around with it (super lame, Dad!). This is funnier though. I didn't model any of the objects. That was going to be my next step, but I was way too overwhelmed with Blender modeling and rigging. I just wanted to get something up and running that I created myself. I'm a designer before I'm a developer. Anyway, here's what my first little game looked like, and I use the term 'game' loosely.

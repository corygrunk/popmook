    <p>So I have very little experience with game development, and even less experience with 3D modeling. I’ve gone through a handful of tutorials (<a href="http://brackeys.com/">Brackeys</a> - thank you!!!!). I started to look into Blender tutorials but quickly became overwhelmed and dishearten. Then, a few days ago I decided to look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPiCgCkHTE&amp;list=PLPV2KyIb3jR42oVBU6K2DIL6Y22Ry9J1c">Brackey’s 2D Platformer</a> course. I was once again energized. I may know nothing about 3D, but I’ve used Photoshop for years, and am confident I can make my own mediocre graphics!</p>

<p>BTW, I’m embarrassed to admit this, but I never put together that a “platformer” was a game where you run across platforms. The more you know.</p>

<p>I started by drawing a pixel version of my old, crappy car. My kids have named her “Field”.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/IMG_0381.jpg" alt="My old crappy car" /></p>

<p>I dropped it in my 2D Platformer tutorial and quickly realized that cars behave weird when they’re replacing characters. Oh well, it was a fun experiment.</p>

<p>So instead of a car, I drew up a pixel version of my kids. If you don’t have kids, you may think this is super lame, but I don’t care. You have free time and expendable income. I have two rad, funny, kids who may be the only ones that play this game.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/IMG_0384.jpg" alt="Pixel kids" /></p>

<p>Until next time.</p>
